CSCI126ProjectReagents.csv -> Recipe_Reagents

CSCI126ProjectRealms.csv -> Realms

CSCI126ProjectRecipes.csv -> Recipes

CSCI126ProjectItemDescriptions -> Items



Use remaining queries of SQL file to test the database.

There was an issue where the importation of CSCI126ProjectRealms.csv -> Realms on MySQL workbench caused a crash.  SQLiteStudio had no issues.
